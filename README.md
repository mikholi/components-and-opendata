<b>Components and open-data assigment.</b>

Here is the URL for the component-assigment:

https://components-and-opendata.vercel.app/

I tried to publish it to Github pages but I couldn't get it to work. I watched tens of different videos from Youtube and read arctiles,
but all I had there was a blank screen and in the console it said some 404-error. I then tried Vercel for publishing and it worked. So that's why Github-pages files remains in the repo, I didn't want to delete them so that it won't broke anything.
